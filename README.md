# goal

A simple command line tool to store a small note.

Running `goal set <message>` will set the note. A deadline can also be specified: `goal set
<message> -d <deadline>`. To see the note, run `goal show`. To edit the note with an editor, run
`goal edit`. The default editor is taken from `$EDITOR`, but it can be overridden with `goal edit -e
<editor>`.
